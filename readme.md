This is our IOT Project we did for our IOT lesson:
We used a Pycom device and pysense module to get temperature, humidity and light data.
We also used 2 Ultrasound sensor to get the number of person coming in or coming out of the park.
Yes, we talked about a park because our IOT prototype has to compute the number of people inside a park and also data of temperature and light and send it to a mysql database.
Then thanks to node-red we gonna use those data to show an interface for people to see the interactions of the park for weeks, months, and also the same day too.
We hope you will like it :)
